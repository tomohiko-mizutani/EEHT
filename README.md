# EEHT - Efficient and Effective Implementation of Hottopixx Methods

This is MATLAB code for the algoithm EEHT, presented in the paper "Tomohiko Mizutani, Implementing Hottopixx Methods for Endmember Extraction in Hyperspectral Images, arXiv, 2024".

## Requirements

You need to install CPLEX and write the path to `cplexlp.m` in the file `setPara.m`.
For example, if CPLEX is installed in the directory Applications on macOS, then edit the file as follows.

```matlab
cplexPath = '/Applications/CPLEX_Studio1210/cplex/matlab/x86-64_osx';
```

In addition, optimization toolbox is needed when reproducing the experiments in Sections VI-B and -C by using `expExtnPerf.m` and `expUnmixUrban.m`.

## Quick Start

To run EEHT for a noisy separable matrix  $A = W H + N$ of size $d \times n$ with factorization rank $r$, type the command in the MATLAB command prompt.

```matlab
run_eeht
```

### Input

- ``d`` : Number of columns  
- ``n`` : Number of rows
- ``r`` : Factorization rank
- ``delta`` : Noise intensity, i.e, delta = $||N||_1$
- ``dataType`` : Choose 'normal' or 'ill-conditioned'
- ``cVal`` : Parameter for generating $\alpha$ such that
                     $\alpha^{(\text{r}-1)} = 10^{(-\text{cVal})}$
- ``seed`` : Seed number for generating random numbers

The input matrices are the same as those of RHHP; see the [webpage](https://github.com/tomohiko-mizutani/RHHP) for the details.

### Output

- Recovery rates by EEHT-A, -B, -C

### Parameters

The parameters $\lambda, \mu$ are used for constructing an initial index set $\mathcal{L}$; see Algorithm 3 of the paper.
You can set the parameter values by editing the file 'setPara.m'.
The default values are $(\lambda, \mu) = (3, 15)$.
For example, when you choose $(\lambda, \mu) = (5, 50)$, open `setPara.m` and write it as follows.

```matlab
lambda = 5;  
mu = 50;
```

Note that the parameters $\lambda, \mu$ should be chosen to satisfy $\lambda r + \mu \le n$ for the number $n$ of columns of $A$ and the factorization rank $r$.

## Experiments in Sections VI-B - Endmember Extraction Performance

Section VI-B of the paper showed the experimental results on the endmember extraction performance of EEHT.
The experiments for datasets 1 and 2 can be reproduced by using `expExtnPerf.m` and `dispRsltExtnPerf.m`
where dataset 1 is constructed from Jasper Ridge HSI and dataset 2 from Samson HSI.
The former code is for conducing experiments and the latter one is for plotting a graph for the results.
To run the code, you need to set the input argument `datasetOpt` according to the table below.

| `datasetOpt` | Dataset for which you apply EEHT |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Dataset 1|
| 2 | Dataset 2|

The following is the example for applying EEHT for dataset 1.
In the experiments, you are recommend to set $(\lambda, \mu) = (10,100)$.
To do so, edit  `setPara.m` as follows.

```matlab
lambda = 10;  
mu = 100;
```

Then, type the command for starting the experiments.

```matlab
expExtnPerf(1)
```

After the code has finished running, you get the output file `rsltExtnPerf_dataset1.mat`.
You can display a graph for the results by using  `dispRsltExtnPerf.m`.
Type the command

```matlab
dispRsltExtnPerf(1)
```

and then a graph is displayed.
The Result directory contains the output files `rsltExtnPerf_dataset1.mat` and `rsltExtnPerf_dataset2.mat`. Below is the graphs generated from them.

## Experiments in Sections VI-C - Hyperspectral Unmixing of Urban HSI

Section VI-C of the paper studied the unmixing of Urban HSI with assuming that there are six endmembers in the image: Asphalt, Grass, Tree, Roof 1, Roof 2 and Soil. Below is the RGB image of Urban.

</p>

You can run EEHT-C for unmixing Urban by using `expUnmixUrban.m` and `dispRsltUnmixUrban.m`.
The former one is for unmixing Urban and the latter one is for plotting abundance maps.
To enhance the unmixing performance,
you are recommended to use a preprocessing technique with parameters $\phi$ and $\omega$ that is
described in Section VI-C.
To run `expUnmixUrban.m` and `dispRsltUnmixUrban.m`, 
it is necessary to set the input argument `preprocOpt` according to the table below.

| `preprocOpt` | Parameters $\phi, \lambda$ |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | $(\phi,\omega) = (0.4,0.1)$ |
| 2   | $(\phi,\omega) = (0.45,0.15)$ |
| 3   | $(\phi,\omega) = (0.5,0.3)$ |
| 4   | $(\phi,\omega) = (0.55,0.45)$ |
| 5   | $(\phi,\omega) = (0.6,0.6)$ |

The following is the example for applying EEHT-C for Urban with $(\phi, \omega)=(0.4, 0.1)$.
You are recommend to set $(\lambda, \mu) = (50,300)$.
To do so, edit  `setPara.m` as follows.

```matlab
lambda = 50;  
mu = 300;
```

Then, type the command for applying EEHT-C with preprocessing with $(\phi, \omega)=(0.4, 0.1)$ for Urban.

```matlab
expUnmixUrban(1)
```

After the code has finished running, you get the output file `rsltUnmixing_preproc1.mat`.
You can display the abundance maps of Urban obtained by EEHT-C by using  `dispRsltUnmixUrban.m`.
Type the command

```matlab
dispRsltUnmixUrban(1)
```

and then abundance maps are displayed.
The Result directory contains the output files
`rsltUnmixing_preproc1.mat`, ..., `rsltUnmixing_preproc5.mat` obtained by performing `expUnmixUrban.m` with `preprocOpt` = 1 to 5.
Below is the abundance maps generated from ``rsltUnmixing_preproc1.mat``.
